### Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on .NET MVC Web solutions and I would like to evolve to SPA technologies (Angular or Blazor).

🌱 I’m allways improving on DevOps (Ansible with Bamboo), Modern Architectures (DDD, Hexagonal...) and Management.

⚡ Fun fact: I studied and graduated on Philosophy before applying for developing jobs.
