### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on MVC5 .NET Web solutions and I would like to evolve to Angular JS technologies.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning DevOps architectures and technologies like Kubernetes, Jenkins... Ansible and Bamboo were my first contact on these matters.

âš¡ Fun fact: I studied and graduated on Philosophy before applying for developing jobs.
